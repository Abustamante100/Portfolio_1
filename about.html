        <h4>Childhood</h4>
        <p>I wish I was one of those people who could say “all my life I knew I was going to be a designer.” However, that would be lying. I wasn’t born with the passion for design. I had to earn it. </p>
        <p>When I was younger, I always loved people. I loved trying to figure out what motivated them and why they moved the way they did. Probably the reason why playing pretend was one of my favorite activities. </p>
        <p>I always thought that this love would lead me to becoming a movie star, never a designer.</p>

        <h4>Hollywood Dreams</h4>
        <p>As I grew up I embodied this childhood, movie star dream. I did the normal thing - working retail, waiting tables, bartending while simultaneously auditioning and taking classes.</p>
        <p>Through this experience I learned a number of things…</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Wash your clothes after you buy it. </li>
          <li>User empathy is important. In order to give the customer the best experience possible you need to cater to their needs and preferences.</li>
          <li>Communicate with your team during high pressure situations. You’ll never survive a busy friday night or a holiday season if you don’t.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>A Need for Change</h4>
        <p>After 8 years  of doing customer service I needed to get out. While I felt like the lessons I learned were valuable, I needed a change. I thought about potential career transitions - personal trainer, architect, HR manager, New York Giants starting quarterback. None of those felt right.</p>
        <p>Eventually I landed on web design. I always viewed myself as a visual person and I enjoyed building my personal Squarespace website. So I decided to give it a try. </p>

        <h4>The Design Journey</h4>
        <p>When I entered the world of design I started with Wordpress. I would use Elementor while simultaneously learning HTML and CSS. Eventually I learned Figma because I wanted to plan my websites before developing them (designing and developing a website on Wordpress at the same time is hell)</p>
        <p>All of this made me feel like I was moving towards the right direction. But I knew something was missing. It wasn’t until a friend told me about Bloc’s immersive program that things really changed.</p>
        <p>Through the program I discovered UX/UI Design. I discovered that designing websites and apps wasn't about decorating but more conveying a message. It gave design a purpose. I learned that there was an actual science to it. It’s about data, research, human motivation and human empathy. It actually combined my strengths, my love for the human mind and my inclination towards the visual.</p>
        <p>With this experience I hope to bring value to your business. I want to give your businesses a voice. I want to help build the bridge between your business and the people who would benefit from it the most.</p>
        <p>If you ever want to talk about potentially working together, the New York Giants or just terrible customer service jobs then reach out! I would love to hear from you.</p>
