          <p class="first_par">CORE is a cloud file manager service dedicated to empowering the filmmaker. It aims to be the homebase for the filmmaker’s journey. With CORE the artist has the ability to create, store and share their filmmaking
            files. </p>

          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p class="first_par">In the beginning of the project I was given a brief by a hypothetical client. In this brief the client laid out a desire to create a new player in the cloud service industry. They outlined features that they wanted
            the application to include. However the problem was with an over saturated market was there enough room for a new competitor in the space? If so, what would that look like? Did users even want or need the features the client listed?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section_2">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Through the UX process I found out that there was room for a new cloud service as long as it was for a specific niche. That’s how CORE became a filmmaking platform.</p>
          <p>Also through my research I found out the key features users needed to create a minimal viable product. These key features were creating an account, logging into an account, creating a file, uploading a file and sharing a file. Through
            the design I made sure to highlight these features. </p>

          <h4>User Survey</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Using Google surveys I was able to collect data on a number of respondents.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Creating content, uploading a file and sharing a file were the top 3 most used and valued features.</li>
            <li>68.8% of cloud service users mainly used their application on their desktop web browser.</li>
            <li>58.8% of users wanted a cloud service for a specific niche.</li>

          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <img src="assets/images/CORE/comp_logos.png" alt="Google Drive, Evernote and Pinterest logos" class="first_pic">
          <p>Using Google docs, I did a competitive analysis on three major cloud services - Google Drive, Evernote and Pinterst. Through the analysis I found that these services made it really easy to do their main story. In
            Google Drive and Evernote, you can easily make content. Pinterest can easily save content. </p>
          <p>However I found that google drive’s content is very general so users of a specific niche would be out of luck if they needed to create a specific niche type file. Evernote can only create one type of file - notes. In addition Evernote
            can’t upload files (You can only attach a file to a note). Then with pinterest, they don’t even give users the ability to create any type of content. </p>

        <section class="section_2">
          <h4>User Personas</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Considering that the data said that users wanted a niche for a cloud service this was the point where I selected film as the market to tackle.</p>
          <p>In an effort to put all the data I collected together and to humanize the potential customers I created user personas. </p>

          <p class="up-p">A lot of the information provided in the user personas were based on data collected on the survey. The demographic questions informed the occupations, age, gender, relationship status of Emma and Xavier. However, one thing
            to note is
            that Xavier was originally a production manager. It wasn’t till I got deeper into the project that I had to come back and change Xavier to an assistant director. I didn’t realize that assistant directors, not producers had more of the
            day-to-day administrative tasks that I was thinking about. </p>
          <p>As for the goals and frustrations, while some of these didn’t become the MVPs of the project, they were based on frustrations and features respondents said they wished they had.</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <section class="first">
          <h4>User Stories</h4>
          <p class="first_par">In order to create the user stories I jumped into the mind of each user persona and I thought about the things they needed to do their job. While both had different prioritization levels for each task I eventually
            came to the conclusion that both groups needed to...</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Create an account</li>
            <li>Log into an account</li>
            <li>Create a document</li>
            <li>Share a file</li>
            <li>Upload a file</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Something to note is that I originally had locking a file and color coding a file as part of the MVPs instead of creating/logging into an account. It wasn’t till I got to wireframing where I realized that those were task users needed! I
            think that I was so focused on the data and the users' wants/frustrations that I didn’t consider the obvious. So I had to go back to add these two tasks in the user stories and user flows. </p>

          <figcaption>My user flow for creating content </figcaption>
          <p>I created a number of user flows based on the user stories I came up with. For speed purposes, I first started with pencil and paper. Then I transferred it digitally to whimsical when I found ones that worked.</p>
          <p> I focused on the main user stories (at first it was to create a document, share a file, upload a file, color code a file, lock a file. Creating and logging into an account was added later.) I also decided in order to not fall victim to
            scope creep, I would only add additional user flows that were closely aligned with the main stories.</p>
          <p>With a lot of user stories taking place on the dashboard, I wanted to focus on flexibility. Something like creating a document for example, was a task that was completed in multiple ways by multiple users. I wanted to cater to those
            uses.</p>

          <p>I did multiple sketches of the different screens. I used the crazy 8 method to force me to think outside the box. Then after that I redesigned some of the sketches I liked till I came up with ones that I felt highlighted the high
            priority task.</p>

          <p>On the Homepage I highlighted the create an account story by making it the biggest element on the page. In addition I placed it along the z-pattern that users' eyes take. When first landing upon the page. </p>

          <p>On the dashboard I highlighted the upload and create a file stories by making their buttons circular while the rest of the elements on the page became geometric. In addition I created space around the buttons to increase the contrast.

          <h4>Discovering a Name</h4>
          <p class="first_par">After going through a few names I came up with the name CORE for this cloud service. I had the idea that this was going to be the filmmakers homebase. This was going to be the CORE of their film project.</p>

          <h4>Creating an Identity</h4>
          <p class="first_par">When doing research for other cloud services I found that they had a very 9-5 feeling. They felt very corporate.</p>
          <p>“Every artist has a small revolution inside of them.”</p>
          <p>I wanted CORE to feel like it was for those indie filmmakers. I wanted it to be rebellious, individualistic, modern, artistic. I really wanted it to be an alternative brand to the Google Drives and the Evernotes. </p>

          <h4>Finding an Image</h4>

          <figcaption>Sketches of early concepts for CORE’s Logo.</figcaption>
          <p>Part of this project was creating a visual identity for CORE. I had to come up with a logo that went with the identity I imagined. The logo went through many iterations. It started with sketching. </p>

          <figcaption>CORE’s logo in various brand colors</figcaption>
          <p>Eventually I settled on this design and it was a long way from where I started. </p>
          <p>The circles give CORE a sleek look while also forming a cloud. Each circle has smaller circles inside them till they reach their CORE. This highlights the idea that CORE is the home for the filmmaker. I also gave a gradient to the cloud
            to
            give it a modern feeling. On top of that the gradient serves another purpose of giving the effect of the circles coming out of the background. That is supposed to represent the artist breaking away from the crowd. </p>

            <p>In order to fix the login process I change the color of the input fields whenever the user has put in information. In addition I changed the example text. At first I thought it would bring a bit of character to the project but I didn’t
              realize that it was confusing the users.</p>

            <figcaption>The first iteration of CORE’s Dashboard. Most elements now have softer edges.</figcaption>
            <p>A major change that I had from transitioning from the middle fidelity wireframes to the high fidelity mockups is the shapes of the elements. When color was added all the elements felt too loud and were shouting for attention. As a
              result,
              I changed most of the elements on the dashboard to have softer, rounded edges. This caused me (in order to keep the contrast) to change the buttons to be more geometric.</p>
            <p>Another reason I wanted to change the shapes had to do with branding. It felt counterproductive to the brand to have circular buttons. One of the reasons for having a dark UI is that it’s a bit edgy and different. Having circular
              buttons
              felt contradictory to that image.</p>

              also

            <p>The task seemed pretty quick with the users. However there was still hesitancy when sharing a file. It was faster than before but users still had trouble identifying the share icon right away. So I replaced the link icon to an envelope

              instead it made it dull. To combat this I added a background image which now I feel speaks CORE’s brand.</p>

            <p>Another comment I was given was that CORE’s dashboard felt a little dull. That nothing jumped off the page. I agreed but didn’t realize it was so obvious. There wasn’t enough budget to add custom icons and fonts which I think would
              have
              really made it stand out. But I did add a gradient on the nav bar which I feel made a huge difference. It helped it pop while also highlighting the high priority stories even more.</p>

        <section class="first">
          <h4>Closing thoughts</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Going into this project I had doubts about there being enough room for another player in the cloud service. But through my research I found out that there was. In order for a new cloud service to exist they would have
            to be dedicated to
            a
            specific niche.</p>
          <p>Also through various degrees of testing I found out that this product works. In the final usability test, users seem to go through the high priority task seamlessly.</p>
          <p>What actually surprised me was how much small tweaks changed the complexion of the project. By doing two small things - adding a picture in the background of the login page and adding a gradient to the navbar of the dashboard - the
            project
            came alive!</p>
          <p>If I was given more time I would have loved to have tried to add dedicated and custom fonts and icons. I feel like it would give the project an even more individualistic look. In addition I would have loved to have created another user
            survey asking filmmakers specifically about a need for a product like this. I would have also liked to have an additional usability test to see if the envelope icon increased recognizability for sharing.</p>
          <p>This project taught me a lot. It taught me that the UX process is fluid. You don’t just finish one deliverable and go to the next. Yes, the last deliverable will inform the next. But the next will also inform the last. It’s ever
            changing.
            They all inform each other.</p>
          <p>Also I learned that a project is never finished. Even though there are changes that I wish I could have made I’m still proud of this project and I could walk away confident that this is a suitable solution to the client’s brief.</p>
