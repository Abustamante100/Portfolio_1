          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p class="first_par">In the beginning of the project I was given a brief by a hypothetical client. In this brief the client laid out a desire to create a new player in the cloud service industry. They outlined features that they wanted
            the application to include. However the problem was with an over saturated market was there enough room for a new competitor in the space? If so, what would that look like? Did users even want or need the features the client listed?</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section_2">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Through the UX process I found out that there was room for a new cloud service as long as it was for a specific niche. That’s how CORE became a filmmaking platform.</p>
          <p>Also through my research I found out the key features users needed to create a minimal viable product. These key features were creating an account, logging into an account, creating a file, uploading a file and sharing a file. Through
            the design I made sure to highlight these features. </p>

        <h3>Discovery and Research</h3>
        <section class="first">
          <h4>User Survey</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Using Google surveys I was able to collect data on a number of respondents. I found out that...</p>

          <section class="stats">
            <div class="percentage">
              <span class="stats-h">68.8%</span>

            <div class="percentage">
              <span class="stats-h">93.8%</span>

            </div>
          </section>

          <p class="inside-p">I also found out that the top 3 most used and valued features by users were creating content, uploading a file and sharing a file.</p>

          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <img src="assets/images/CORE/comp_logos.png" alt="Google Drive, Evernote and Pinterest logos" class="first_pic">
          <figcaption>Logos of the companies I did an analysis on.</figcaption>
          <p>Using Google docs, I did a competitive analysis on three major cloud services - Google Drive, Evernote and Pinterst. Through the analysis I found that these services made it really easy to do their main story. On Google Drive and
            Evernote, users can easily make content. On Pinterest, users can easily save content. </p>
          <p>However, I found that google drive’s content is very general. So users that need a specific niche type file would be out of luck. Evernote can only create one type of file - notes. In addition Evernote can’t upload files (Users can only
            attach a file to a note). Then with Pinterest, they don’t even give users the ability to create any type of content.</p>

          <h4>User Personas</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Considering that the data said that users wanted a niche for a cloud service, this was the point of the project where I selected film as the market to tackle.</p>
          <p>In an effort to humanize all the data that was collected, I built user personas.</p>

          <p>However, one thing
            to note is
            that Xavier was originally a production manager. It wasn’t till I got deeper into the project that I had to come back and change Xavier to an assistant director. I didn’t realize that assistant directors, not producers had more of the
            day-to-day administrative tasks that I was thinking of.</p>
          <p>As for the goals and frustrations, while some of these didn’t become the MVPs of the project, they were all based on current frustrations and potential features respondents wished they had.</p>

        <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
        <section class="first">
          <h4>User Stories</h4>
          <p class="first_par">In order to create the user stories, I jumped into the mind of each user persona. I thought about the things they needed to do their job. While both had different prioritization levels assigned to each task, I
            eventually came to the conclusion that both groups needed to…</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Create an account</li>
            <li>Log into an account</li>
            <li>Create a document</li>
            <li>Share a file</li>
            <li>Upload a file</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="short-p">Something to note is that I originally had locking a file and color coding a file as part of the MVPs instead of creating/logging into an account. It wasn’t till I got to the wireframing stage where I realized that those
            were task users needed! I think that I was so focused on the data and the users' wants/frustrations that I didn’t consider the obvious. So I had to go back to add these two tasks in the user stories and user flows.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section_2">
          <h4>User Flows</h4>
          <img src="assets/images/CORE/user_flow.png" alt="Picture of user flow for creating content on CORE" class="first_pic">
          <figcaption>CORE's user flow for creating content </figcaption>
          <p>I created a number of user flows based on the user stories I came up with. For speed purposes, I first started with pencil and paper. When I found ones that I felt were extremely intuitive, I used Whimsical to transfer them onto a
            digital platform.</p>
          <p>I focused on the main stories. At first it was to create a document, share a file, upload a file, color code a file and lock a file. Creating and logging into an account was added later.</p>
          <p>I also decided in order to not fall victim to scope creep, I would only add additional user flows that were closely aligned with the main stories.</p>
          <p>Something else I tried to focus on was flexibility. Take the story creating a content for example. To complete this task users can do it through the create button, they could do it by right clicking or they could do it though the search
            bar. I did this because I felt like it was a task that was commonly completed in different ways by different users. I wanted to cater to that.</p>

          <figcaption>Some of the early sketches I made for CORE’s homepage and dashboard</figcaption>
          <p>I did multiple sketches of CORE's different screens. I used the crazy 8 method to force me to think outside the box. After, I selected the sketches that I felt highlighted the high priority task the best. I then continued to iterate on
            them.</p>

          <h4>Digital wireframes</h4>

          <figcaption>The initial wireframe for CORE’s home page.</figcaption>
          <p class="inside-p">On the Homepage I wanted to highlight the create an account story. In order to do this I made the create an account section the biggest element on the page. In addition, I placed it along the z-pattern that users' eyes
            take when they first land on a web page.</p>

          <figcaption>The initial wireframe for CORE’s dashboard.</figcaption>
          <p class="inside-p">On the dashboard, my goal was to highlight the upload and create a file stories. To do this , I created contrast between their buttons and the rest of the page. I made the buttons circular while the rest of the

          <p class="first_par">I did a usability test on two users. One of the tests was in person and the other was done remotely through Zoom. I tested them on 5 tasks. (Looking back at it I should have tested on just the high priority task but
            I made the mistake of focusing on the users frustrations instead of the MVPS.)</p>

          <p class="CORE-quote">“Every artist has a small revolution inside of them.”</p>

          <p class="inside-p">I wanted CORE to feel like it was for indie filmmakers. I wanted it to be rebellious, individualistic, modern and artistic. I really wanted it to feel like an alternative brand to the Google Drives and the Evernotes of

          <p>The circles give CORE a sleek look while also forming a cloud. Each circle has smaller circles inside them. The inner circles continue to shrink till they reach their CORE. This highlights the idea that CORE is the center of the
            filmmaker’s journey. I also gave the circles a slight gradient. This gives the logo a modern feeling. On top of that, the gradient serves an additional purpose. It gives the circles the effect of coming out of the background. This is
            supposed to represent the artist breaking away from the crowd.</p>

          <figcaption>My first attempt at CORE’s homepage</figcaption>
          <p>After discovering CORE's identity, I designed the product's first high fidelity mockups. With these mockups I not only aimed to add CORE's new brand but I set out to attempt to fix the problems I discovered from the previous usability
            test.</p>

          <section class="section_3">
            <h5>Fix #1</h5>

              </div>
            </div>

            <p>In order to fix the login process I changed the color of active input fields. Now whenever the user puts their information in, The input fields turn white. In addition, I changed the example text of the inactive fields. At first, I
              thought the original text would bring character to the project but it just ended up being confusing for the users.</p>

            <figcaption>The first iteration of CORE’s Dashboard. Most elements now have softer edges.</figcaption>
            <p>A major change that I made when transitioning from the original wireframes to the high fidelity mockups was the shapes of elements. When color was added to the project all the elements felt too loud. It was as if they were shouting for
              attention.</p>
            <p> To alleviate that feeling, I changed most of the elements on the dashboard to have softer, rounded edges. This caused me (in order to keep the contrast) to change the create and upload buttons to be more geometric.</p>
            <p>Another reason I changed the shapes had to do with branding. It felt counterproductive to the brand to have circular buttons. One of the reasons for having a dark UI is that it’s a bit edgy and different. Having circular buttons felt
              contradictory to that image.</p>

            <p>Another piece of feedback I was given was that CORE’s dashboard felt a little lackluster. They said that it was okay but nothing jumped off the page. I agreed with the comment. If there was enough time and budget I could have added
              custom icons and fonts. I think that it would have really helped to make this project feel more original.</p>
            <p>However, I did add a gradient on the nav bar. I feel like this made a huge difference. It helped the project pop more. In addition it also increased the visibility of some of CORE’s high priority stories (create and upload).</p>

              a
              specific niche.</p>

            <p>In addition, I would have loved to have created another user survey specifically for filmmakers. I think this would have given me greater insight. It would have helped me cater the project to the specific market even more.</p>
            <p>I also would have liked to have had an additional usability test. I think it would have helped to see if the changes I made created a difference. Especially when users are sharing a file. </p>

            <h5>What I learned</h5>
            <p class="first_par2">This project taught me a lot. It taught me that the UX process is fluid. You don’t just finish one deliverable and go to the next. Yes, the last deliverable will inform the next. But the next will also inform the
              last. It’s ever
              changing.
              They all inform each other.</p>
            <p>I also learned that a project is never finished. Even though there are changes that I wish I could have made I’m still proud of this project. I feel I could walk away confident that this is a suitable solution to the client’s brief.
