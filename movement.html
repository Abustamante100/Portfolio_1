          <p class="first_par">Movement is a health and fitness tracker app dedicated to helping users reach their fitness goals. No matter how they may define them. The app gives users the ability to track their personal health and fitness progress,
            log custom workouts, and even discover new workouts.</p>

          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Exercise is important. We all know that. It improves health, boosts daily energy and enhances mood. While many people aim to increase their level of physical activity, not many of them are able to achieve their fitness
            goals. When I created Movement I wanted to help fix this. <span class="bold">The problem I set out to solve was “How could we better help our users in achieving their fitness goals?”</span></p>
        </section>

        <section class="section_2">
          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p class="first_par">The solution I came up with wasn’t what I thought it was going to be. Through the UX process I found out that users personal fitness and health was, well - personal. Everyone defined their goals in a different way.
            Everyone had different types of workout routines. This concept became the emphasis of Movement.</p>
          <p>Movement’s features revolved around not only tracking the user’s progress and workouts, but also allowing users to control what and how these things were tracked.</p>
          <p>I found that the key features needed to create a minimal viable product were making an account, logging into an existing account, creating a progress graph, logging a workout and finding a workout.</P>

        <h3>Discovery and Research</h3>
        <section class="first">
          <h4>User Survey</h4>
          <p class="first_par">Using Google surveys, I created a survey centered around personal fitness and fitness tracker apps. I wanted to get insight into what our potential users' motivations and frustrations were. I found out that…</p>

          <section class="stats-movement">
            <h5>Non physically active users</h5>
            <div class="percentage1">
              <span class="stats-h">71.4%</span>
              <p class="stats-p">Listed time constraints as a barrier to not exercising</p>
            </div>
            <div class="percentage2">
              <span class="stats-h">57.1%</span>
              <p class="stats-p">Listed lack of knowledge as a barrier to not exercising</p>
            </div>

            <h5>Physically active users</h5>
            <div class="percentage1">
              <span class="stats-h">72.7%</span>
              <p class="stats-p">Listed health as their primary motivation</p>
            </div>
            <div class="percentage2">
              <span class="stats-h">54.5%</span>
              <p class="stats-p"> Currently are using fitness tracker apps</p>
            </div>
          </section>

          <p class="inside-p">I also found out that from the users currently using personal fitness trackers apps, they mainly used them to log a workout, keep track of body metrics, and analyze fitness progress.</p>
          <p>In addition, when physically active users were asked what features they would most like to see in a fitness tracker app, workout suggestions and deeper progression metrics were the top two features users wanted.</p>
          <p>Before performing the survey I believed that progression, social sharing/community features, and digital awards/accomplishments would help motivate users. But from the research it looked like a strictly personal journey. Users didn’t
            seem to care about awards and community as much as they did care about their own progress.</p>

          <p class="inside-p">One of the most challenging parts was dealing with gated features. Without a budget I couldn’t fully experience what all these applications had to offer. In addition, with the time constraints, I couldn’t see how their
            progress and tracking features worked after months of use. I had to rely heavily on reviews and photos to get a full picture.</p>

          <section class="section_2">
            <h4>UX Interviews</h4>
            <p class="first_par">In order to get a deeper look into the thought process of our potential users, I reached out to 3 survey participants to conduct UX interviews.</p>

            <p>I came up with a list of potential questions to ask them surrounding
              their experience with personal fitness and tracker apps. The interviews lasted around 20-30 minutes. In these interviews I found out that....
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>They all participated in different fitness activities. Some like to run, one likes to walk and do yoga while the other likes to do pilates. It all varied. </li>
              <li>It wasn’t necessarily the personal records or the image in the mirror, but the feeling that they got that really mattered to them.</li>
              <li>Participants stated that they never used, or that they stopped using fitness tracker apps because they didn’t cater to their type of goals and workouts.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="short-p">The most challenging part of this deliverable was staying neutral and trying not to lead the participant in any direction. This was especially important when the interviews didn’t go where I expected them to.</p>
            <p>I found that the more prepared I was the better the interviews went. That meant that I had a different list of questions to ask based on the answers that were given.</p>
            <p>Another thing I discovered was that the interviews that went the best were the ones that weren’t forced. I gained the most insight when I focused on listening and reacting to the interviewee’s answers rather than trying to cram all my
              questions in.</p>

            <p class="inside-p">All the information in these user personas were taken from the data that was collected. That includes the demographic information.</p>
            <p>Something to note with these user personas is that this is the 2nd version. In the original version there was a heavy emphasis on weightlifting, hitting numbers and gaining muscle. It wasn’t until I started my user stories that I
              realized that my personal biases had influenced my personas.</p>
            <p> When I think of fitness I think of lifting weights, hitting personal records, looking good. I don’t really care about how painful the experience is. I could cry, scream and complain, I could hate every second of it. I could be in pain
              for days, but as long as I hit my goals that’s all that mattered.</p>
            <p>I didn’t anticipate that not everyone would share this viewpoint. Participants seem to put a lot more emphasis on the feeling of the workout rather than the results. I also didn’t realize that users would take part in many different
              types of fitness activities. Not just lifting weights. So I had to go back and edit the user personas to match the data collected rather than my own personal biases.</p>

          <h4>User Stories</h4>
          <p class="first_par">I created my user stories with the same 3 roles as my user personas - Busy beginner, holistic practitioner and fitness enthusiast. While each persona had different levels of prioritization for each task, I found that when I took all their needs into account our users wanted to…</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Create an account</li>
            <li>Log into an existing account</li>
            <li>Track their progress</li>
            <li>Input fitness activities</li>
            <li>Discover a workout</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="short-p">These became the MVPs of the project.</p>

          <p>The challenge I ran into was at the midpoint of this deliverable. It was what I mentioned in the user personas section. I started to realize that my user stories weren’t matching up with my user personas. I began to have doubts about my work. I was confused. I reflected on the user data and I realized that my own biases were bleeding into the work. So I updated my user personas to more closely align to the data I’ve collected.</p>
